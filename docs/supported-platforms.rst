Supported platforms
===================

Python
------

jak is explicitly tested on Pythons:

- 3.6
- 3.7
- 3.8
- 3.9
- PyPy3

jak follows the `Python end of support dates <https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html#branchstatus>`_, which in practice means that support ends on the following dates:

- 3.6 (PEP 494) support ends 2021-12-23
- 3.7 (PEP 537) support ends 2023-06-27
- 3.8 (PEP 569) support ends 2024-10

Operating Systems
--

We believe jak should work well on most `*nix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like>`_ systems. But is mainly developed on Ubuntu and tested on Ubuntu and macOS.
