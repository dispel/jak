jak is a tool for encrypting files. jak works extra well if used in a git repository.

.. warning::

  jaks encryption works. But use is under your own responsibility. I would highly recommend you take the auto-commit hook on a dry run before actually relying on it.



Install
-------

.. sourcecode:: shell

   pip install jak



Quickstart
----------

.. sourcecode:: shell

   cd ~/folderThatMayOrMayNotBeARepo
   jak start

   edit jakfile # add which files you want to have be encrypted.

   jak encrypt all

   # All files listen in the jakfile should now be encrypted.

We also made this video that might be helpful for running through a basic setup in a git repository.

.. raw:: html

  <!-- If someone has a better way of doing this for readthedocs i'm all ears. -->
  <div class="asciinema-container--quickstart"></div>
  <script>
    var container = document.getElementsByClassName("asciinema-container--quickstart")[0];
    var href = window.location.href;
    var basePath = href.substring(href.lastIndexOf('/'), 0);
    var child = document.createElement('asciinema-player');
    child.setAttribute('src', basePath + '/_static/videos/quickstart.json');
    container.appendChild(child);
  </script>
